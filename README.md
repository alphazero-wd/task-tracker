# About the Project: 
+ This is a CRUD To Do Application which was built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS).
+ User can: add a task, update a task name, mark a task as completed or important, delete the task, and view the date when a task was created.
+ Most importantly, manual authentication with JSONWebToken and Google OAuth were integrated so that only the tasks that belong to a specific user are shown.
+ The website was deployed using Heroku for the server-side and Netlify for client-side.  

# Hope you enjoy the project and give me some feedbacks on my work. I greatly appreciate that!
